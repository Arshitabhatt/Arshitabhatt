I'm a book dragon who hungrily devour stories, novels, fictions, poems. I'm also a book detective who causually peeps into your titles & find all about it's plot in minutes. I listen to podcasts watch T.V. series, anime (current watch Demon Slayer) etc. I love to speak out my ideas, debate on various topics and keep myself updated with current affairs. I occasionally like to pass on random facts about a thing or two.

### What are my goals?

JavaScript, Python and Biology are my love, and as I am growing, I trying to learn and develop in the direction of my goals which are : 

* Short term goals : To recieve a full time oppotunity as a software developer, fullstack developer or machine learning engineer for upcoming years, gain experience and connect with inspiring developers/ researcher, be independent.

* Mid term goals : Go for higher studies for AI in healthcare domain or Environment projection domain, complete MS/Mtech and PhD, work on awesome research projects either in academia or industry.   

* Life long goals: I aspire to create a positive social impact by working primarily in Healthcare and Environment protection domain. Build a vast library of my own book collection learn all there is to learn in this world, and try to be guide for inquisitive minds!

### What I do in my free time?
I'm a book dragon who hungrily devour stories, novels, fictions, poems. I'm also a book detective who causually peeps into your titles & find all about it's plot in minutes. I listen to podcasts watch TV series. I love to speak out my ideas, debate on various topics and keep myself updated with current affairs. I occasionally like to pass on random facts about a thing or two.

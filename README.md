# Welcome, Visitor Infinity! :wave:

I am Arshita Bhatt, I'm a Delhi-NCR based computer science engineer, who likes to develop simple & here-to-stay websites using ReactJS, Nodejs, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Firebase stack as well as apply Machine Learning/Deep Learning using Python for research-based projects.

I'm an avid learner who is always ready to pick up new skills, A thinker who tries to find ways & apply them to make things work, An evolver who likes to work with the flow.

I'm also a book detective who causually peeps into your titles & find all about it's plot in minutes, I love to speak out my ideas, I occasionally likes to pass on random facts about a thing or two.
